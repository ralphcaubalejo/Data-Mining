Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia, is known to provide information of every topic imaginable. Its contents are provided via a peer-reviewed open collaboration. A quick google search of a certain topic will almost always return a Wikipedia link in the first page of results. However as much as this can be widely and easily accessed, this can also be edited and updated by basically anyone who has an internet connection. This means that the content of Wikipedia is ever growing, collecting different information and interpretations from people all around the world regardless of a person’s qualifications.

This study attempts to explore exactly that concept of interconnectedness through Wikipedia’s hyperlinks. Using the English Wikipedia dump, the study seeks to understand the relationship of concepts centered around a chosen Wikipedia topic through a network analysis of Wikipedia abstract hyperlinks.

The models that will be used are capable of generating networks of any topic in the dataset. For the purpose of this research, the “Asian Institute of Management” and “Data Wrangling” Wikipedia pages will be used as examples. Aside from generating a network of their related topics, the models also offer a recommendation system that will generate the most relevant topics based on its closeness centrality and will ultimately provide both a visual and quantitative analysis of the topic of interest.
